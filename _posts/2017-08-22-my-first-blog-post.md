Wow, my first blog post and I don't have anything to talk about (just kidding). Actually, this is just a test page. I probably kill this page in the future but let it live for now! 

Plus I can create a list of my upcoming posts as a reminder

In the coming week, I probably write about 
 - Blogging on GitHub with Jekyll
 - LaTex and Markdown
 - Two or more factor authentication, 3D passwords, and one time passwords

Stay tuned, but I think this is enough for today.

Ciao

Wait for a second, did you know ciao (ቻዎ) is Italian? You probably do but I bet you didn't know it is technically a greeting.

It formally translates to "Hello" in English, "addio" is the formal way to say "Good bye" in Italian.

The good news is you can use ciao in non-formal/friendly conversations.

Arrivederci
