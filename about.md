Hi there

My name is **Samson** (you can call me **Sam**) and this is my blog.

I'm from **Ethiopia** lives in **Addis Abeba**. I graduated in Software Engineering last year *(2016)* and now am working for some government organization.

I spend most of my time surfing the web and reading staff. I really love anything techy especially in the realm of software and web.

The reason I started blogging is that some of my friends told me I got a lot to talk about so I think it's convenient to start a blog. 

I will mostly talk about software but I will be talking about other staff (my observations) too.
